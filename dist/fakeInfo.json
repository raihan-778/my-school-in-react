Fill in the picture with tons of color; channel your inner kid and draw the most daring picture you can. Soak in the picture of your future. Dobrowolski says the brain emits serotonin when you draw, leaving you feeling creative and happy."

    "address": "From children's own perspective, play and learning are not always separate in practices during early years. The purpose of this article is, first, to scrutinise the background and character of early years education in terms of play and learning. Second, to elaborate the findings of several years of research about children's learning in preschool related to the curriculum of early years education and, finally, to propose a sustainable pedagogy for the future, which does not separate play from learning but draws upon the similarities in character in order to promote creativity in future generations"
